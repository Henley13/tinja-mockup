<p>The platform itself is user friendly and intuitive. As a first step on the platform, visitor states his postal/zip code and declares himself as a homeowner, unemployed person, or owner of a company which deals with solar panels installments. After the initial step, additional menu appears, depending on how a visitor presented himself.</p>
<p>Homeowners get the information on how suitable stated location (based on the zip code stated initially) for solar panels installment is, with the information being provided on interactive map.</p>
